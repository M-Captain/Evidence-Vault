# EvidenceVault

Traditional Evidence storing system has these following flaws:

❌ Corruption & Tampering in Law Enforcement – Centralized control allows corrupt officials to manipulate or destroy digital evidence, obstructing justice and protecting offenders.<br>
❌ Lack of Transparency – Evidence handling lacks visibility; there's no real-time public or cross-agency audit trail, making it easier to cover up misconduct.<br>
❌ Restricted Access & Gatekeeping – Victims, lawyers, and watchdog agencies often struggle to access crucial evidence, as it's controlled by a few authorities with no accountability.<br>
❌ Poor Inter-Agency Collaboration – Different law enforcement and judicial bodies operate in silos, leading to inefficiencies and delays in transferring or verifying evidence.<br>

A Blockchain-Powered, Decentralized Evidence Management System

✅ Tamper-Proof Evidence Storage<br>
 Blockchain immutability ensures evidence cannot be altered, deleted, or forged—protecting against internal corruption and data manipulation.<br>
✅ Transparent Audit Trails<br>
 Every action on a piece of evidence (upload, access, transfer) is recorded on-chain, creating a real-time, verifiable log accessible to authorized stakeholders.<br>
✅ Decentralized Access Control<br>
 Smart contracts manage access rights dynamically, reducing dependency on any single authority—ensuring victims, legal counsel, and oversight bodies can access data based on permissions.<br>
✅ Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) for Case Ownership<br>
 Victims and authorized investigators can securely manage and track their related evidence using SSI principles, increasing agency and reducing institutional gatekeeping.<br>
✅ Cross-Agency Interoperability<br>
 Standardized protocols enable secure sharing of evidence across police, judiciary, and forensic departments—streamlining case handling and eliminating silos.<br>

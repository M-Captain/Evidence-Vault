A decentralized, tamper-proof platform for storing, sharing, and validating legal evidence. Built to ensure authenticity, ownership, and security of sensitive legal documents using blockchain and encryption.

✅ Evidence immutability via blockchain  
✅ Zero trust architecture – No reliance on intermediaries  
✅ Self-sovereign control and cryptographic ownership of evidence  
✅ IPFS-based distributed storage  
✅ Proxy Re-Encryption with NuCypher for secure sharing  
✅ Legal-grade audit trail and integrity guarantees

## ⚖️ The Problem EnviVault Solves

In traditional legal workflows, evidence such as documents, videos, and audios are handled by multiple intermediaries before reaching the court. This creates several vulnerabilities:

❌ **Evidence Tampering** – Malicious actors can alter or destroy evidence  
❌ **Chain of Custody Issues** – Trust is assumed, not verifiable  
❌ **Opaque Processes** – Users can't trace what happens to their evidence  
❌ **Centralized Risk** – Single points of failure make sensitive data vulnerable

## ✅ Our Solution

EnviVault enables a seamless, secure and transparent flow of evidence submission using blockchain, IPFS and encryption:

- **Immutable Storage**: All evidence data is uploaded to IPFS and its hash is stored on a blockchain.
- **Trustless Transactions**: The user signs the submission with their public key, and the platform handles gas fees on their behalf.
- **UI Simplicity**: Users only need to fill in evidence metadata (name, type, description, date), and EnviVault does the rest behind the scenes.
- **Organization-Paid Transactions**: The backend verifies hashes and submits the transaction using the organization's blockchain account.
- **Encrypted Uploads**: Evidence files are encrypted using **NuCypher** before being pushed to IPFS.
